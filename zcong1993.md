> just did the following things make the repos more clean and friendly for beginers

### 1. add `package.json`

friendly for others, cause people can install all 3rd part packages your project used only use `npm install`

### 2. refractory project folder and file

use names which are more readable or offical recommended

### 3. refractory json data store

see `router/index.js`

### 4. more

see the comments
