# First-Nodejs-Expressjs

This is my first server code with nodejs and expressjs.
I decide to start to learn node!
Thank you if you can provide any suggestion!
If you are a beginner we can learn together.

## start

```bash
# clone first
$ git clone https://github.com/chinazhangyujia/First-Nodejs-Expressjs.git
$ cd First-Nodejs-Expressjs
# install dependencies
$ npm install
# serve
$ npm start # or node app.js
```
